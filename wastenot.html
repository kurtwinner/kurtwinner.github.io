<p>Sadly, sometimes crossing systems fail, or our furry friends ignore crossings in their hurry. When that happens, you may have an injured squirrel.</p>
<p>As wildlife, in theory they are the responsibility of your wildlife agency, but rarely will agencies respond.</p>
<p>In that case, you must, if you wish to care for our damaged furry friends, convey them to a veterinary clinic for treatment, or take care of Squirrel yourself, both at your own expense.</p>

<p>If Squirrel is beyond help, you now have some Roadkill which can, <i>waste not, want not</i>, be a tasty treat, if your area allows.</p>
<p>Roadkill laws vary in each state, province, and territory; please consult your area wildlife agency, or you can use <a href="http://www.stoneaxeherbals.com/2016/06/here-are-roadkill-laws-in-all-50-states.html">this guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Recipies</h2>
<p>If you have satisfied yourself that roadkill is legal in your area, recipies to cook nature's bounty are listed in the box at upper left.</p>
