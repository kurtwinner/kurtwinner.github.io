                  <p>
                  Every day, thousands of squirrels needlessly die on the streets of Portland. <br>  <strong> It doesn't have to be this way.</strong><br>  Drivers and cyclists could use more caution and watch out for animals darting out in front of them while on the road.
                  </p>
                   <p> A recent driver tells us, "I didn't even see it until it was too late, I feel horrible."                        </p>
                   <p> Drivers and cyclists are advised to slow down 5 miles per hour in neighborhoods where wildlife is abundant. </p>
